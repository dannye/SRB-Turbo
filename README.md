# Super Retro Beat: TURBO

SRB: Turbo is a fast-paced rhythm game (like DDR or Guitar Hero).
The game is an original Gameboy game developed in 40 hours by [dannye][dannye],
[zachilles9614][zachilles9614], and [anprobst][anprobst].
It was submitted to the eHacks 2018 hackathon and awarded the prize for
"Most Ambitious".

In places where the code is very ugly, that's because we tried to code
each feature in the fastest way we knew how.

SRB: Turbo is based off of [bootstrap.gb][bootstrap.gb] by [yenatch][yenatch].

To build, install [rgbds][rgbds] and put it in your path.
Then run `make`. This will create `srb-turbo.gb`.
Then run the ROM in any decent GB emulator or flash the ROM on a flash
cart and play the game on a real Gameboy or Gameboy Color.
